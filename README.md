# StarRaft_LoreEngine


An indie management sim about life aboard a generational colony ship launched from a doomed earth. Now defunct, my contributions include several optimized low-poly 3d models and a “Lore Engine” which plots the relative position of the origin point (earth) and distance to other ships in light years. The ships were to communicate with each other, with messages delayed over multiple light years. The engine reads XML files indicating the starting position, heading and the various message chains sent over the years of travel. Written in C# for integration with Unity using Visual studio Community.
