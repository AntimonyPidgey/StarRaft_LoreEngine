A 2x2 tile building that anchors a strong wire stretched between two points on the opposite sides of the ship. 
Sized for up to ten people, riding it is a rather discomfiting experience as the gravity fades slowly and returns reversed as you reach the other side, 
though the chamber is built to accomodate this gravity reversal as conveniently as possible.

Technical:
The model is split into two parts, the pad and chamber. For ease of animation, the chamber origin is set to allow it to fit perfectly in the pad
when the chamber's origin is equal to the pad's. I recommend that you add the chamber to the pad as a child and use the pad's local coordinate 
system in unity so you just have to raise or lower the Z value to make the chamber move.
