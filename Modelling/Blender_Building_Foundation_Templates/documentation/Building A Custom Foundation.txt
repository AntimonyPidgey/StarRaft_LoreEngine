beyond the scope of these instructions.

1. Load Template_1x1.blend.

2. Right-Click the foundation to select it.

3. If you're not in default view, switch back to it.

4. On the right-hand side of the screen you should be able to see the Transform toolbar. 
   Locate the "Dimensions" field.

5. Adjust the X and Y values in Dimensions as you see fit, to whole numbers *ONLY*.
