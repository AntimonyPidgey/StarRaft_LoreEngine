Foundations
-----------
Using a foundation template even as a temporary measure is a good idea; it allows you to plan and adjust on the fly the layout and composition of your project. 
It also serves as a "buffer" zone between your building and the ground, enabling it to handle uneven or curved ground gracefully. Templates (and building models)
should follow these standard rules for ease of programmer implementation:

1: Global Positioning and Facing
   -----------------------------
   At position 0, 0, 0, the "front" of the building should be facing in the opposite direction to the green arrow on your transform tool. 
   The point of origin of any building is the lowest left-hand front corner. On the provided templates that will be the corner of the foundation. 
   That point of origin should be placed at global position 0, 0, 0. This allows the programmers to "snap" the buildings together,
   without having to adjust for wildly different origins in terms of absolute and local co-ordinates.

2: Standardized Building Tile Dimensions and Layout
   ------------------------------------------------
   All buildings conform to a total tile size that lines up exactly with one blender unit per tile. 
   It can take up 2x2, 1x1, 1x2, 4x4 or even 3 tiles in an L shape, but no part of a building is permitted to exist outside of its claimed space.
   If there is any overhang, consider claiming another tile if it's big enough, or otherwise reshaping or re-positioning the overhang. 
   Exceptions can be made for buildings that are seperate but designed to be "socketed" together.
   This helps to prevent clipping issues in tiles that happen to be close together.

 
   The foundation can be of any reasonable height, but to give sufficient leeway it should be at least 0.05 units tall.

3: Standard Intended Inhabitant Scale
   ----------------------------------
   Buildings with doors and equipment for human use should have those fittings be scaled accordingly, and all for the same size human.  
   After some experimentation, I propose that the template human be a cube of dimensions x:0.05 y:0.05 z:0.15 blender units. 
   Such a cube is included with each of the tile templates accompanying this document.
